As a beginner to Django framework, I don't have any problems or challenges encountered when installing it and adding to the web repository. I've been working with web frameworks like Laravel and Ruby on Rails during my bachelor's degree, and somehow it has similarities when providing routes and views to the Django framework. I have a sufficient knowledge in Python, and adding a Django framework to the web repository was easy.

However, I encountered a challenge where the added route doesn’t work. I checked the `urls.py` and added a correct path for each HTML templates. I didn’t know that the directories should be explicitly added inside `DIRS = []` in `config/settings.py`. After I added the working directories such as `core` and `templates`, I can finally add the routes to each of the HTML templates successfully. The lesson was complete, from installing Django up to adding HTML template views with Django, which is the reason I only encountered minor challenges.
